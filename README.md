Frosty Friday Week 3

Frosty Friday Inc., your benevolent employer, has an S3 bucket that was filled with .csv data dumps. These dumps arenâ€™t very complicated and all have the same style and contents. All of these files should be placed into a single table.

However, it might occur that some important data is uploaded as well, these files have a different naming scheme and need to be tracked. We need to have the metadata stored for reference in a separate table. You can recognize these files because of a file inside of the S3 bucket. This file, keywords.csv, contains all of the keywords that mark a file as important.
